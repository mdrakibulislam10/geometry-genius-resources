                    id-name(select only one element), class-name(select multiple elements), tag-name(select
                    elements by tag name) and for selecting like CSS selector- query-selector(select only the first
                    element with class or tag name) and query-selector-all(select all elements with class or tag

                <p class="">The code can be reduce by using event bubble. If the parent element provides a handler, its
                    child elements receive that event handler.
                    That event first capture the parent element then, capture child elements. But when event are active
                    then, child element get the event priority first. This priority of events getting from bottom to top
                    it's called the event bubble.
